            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>STWebDesigner was founded on 29th August 2014 by Sophie Thomas to provide Web Design and Development tips, tutorials and news. The purpose of creating STWebDesigner was to share my knowledge about Web Design and Development as I learn. This has been done by sharing tips and news through different social media platforms and producing video tutorials that are accessible on this website and YouTube. All of these are shared and produced free of charge to help you. </p>
